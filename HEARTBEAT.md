- Check `nofx-trading` logs and database statistics every few hours.
- Run `monitor_losses.py` to check for consecutive loss streaks.
- Update `GOAL_100K.md` with the latest Equity, Win Rate, and Profit Factor.
- If Equity increases by >$50 since last check, or reaches a milestone ($400, $500, etc.), explicitly notify the user with a progress report.
